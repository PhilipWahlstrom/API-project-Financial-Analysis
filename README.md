# API project Financial Analysis
# Was The FED Wrong?

The goal of this project was for me to practice connecting to an API, download data, clean it, and present various graphs while telling a story. The story I chose was basically:

"After the financial crisis in 2008, the FED saved the day by lowering interest rates and printing money. But then they went on chasing the 2% inflation goal to an extent that it favours the rich and leaves the poor behind." 

Obviously I do not have enough data here in this presentation to prove if this is correct or not, but it makes for a more interesting story for presenting data. So the analysis below is by no means complete, so take the whole thing with a grain of salt. The focus is the coding.

## A note of the graphs:
The graphs are ment to be used in a Power Point presentation, so I formated and designed them for that purpose.
